[Help desk agent work instruction](/assets/other/hd_wi.pdf)  |  [Laptop user's guide](/assets/other/lptp_trn.pdf)


When I produced these items, I worked as an internal help desk agent and process manager for an international reinsurance corporation. As process manager, I performed technical writing tasks such as contributing information to the knowledgebase used to answer customers' questions and solve their issues, producing work instructions for help desk agents, and providing information to the rest of the company from the information technology department. 

The audience of the [work instruction](/assets/other/hd_wi.pdf) was help desk agents. It provides instructions to complete a process as part of a larger effort to solve a networking issue. Information in the knowledgebase would guide them to this process and then direct them to the next part of the effort. I produced it in Microsoft Word and from a template I created to automate including information in the first-page header using VBScript. 

The [selection of pages](/assets/other/lptp_trn.pdf) from a laptop user's guide I produced in the same role. At the time (approximately 2000), the company was issuing laptop computers to some employees in replacement of the desktop computers. These people were expected to use the laptop computers while in the office as well as while working remotely. However, no training in doing so was provided. 

We at the help desk became aware of this as calls and questions came to us about laptops and their use. Aware of this trend and with customers' questions and issues recorded by help desk agents, I went to management with the idea to provide an introductory training course and user's guide on the use of laptop computers and working remotely. My idea was approved and I produced the guide, had it printed internally by the corporate print shop, and arranged the details and resources of conducting the courses. Over approximately the next two years, I conducted the courses bi-monthly or as demand dictated, laptop users were provided copies of the guide when their desktop computers were replaced, and help desk metrics showed a decrease in questions about basic laptop use and working remotely.

This sample contains descriptive, procedural, and troubleshooting types of information and artwork describing parts of a laptop. I produced the guide in Microsoft Word.
