    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Spotlight: Enhancing the Snowball Edge Client Experience</h4>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Consider the [Configuring and using the Snowball Edge Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/using-client-commands.html) topic, a prime example of my impact. This topic was a consistent source of user frustration. My comprehensive audit, aligned with AWS's style and content strategy, revealed:
        * Content bloat: It tried to be an exhaustive catalog of every available client command.
        * Inconsistent updates: New commands were often siloed in other documents, leaving this topic incomplete and out of sync.
        * Missing essentials: It failed to address the foundational knowledge users needed, such as how to install and configure the client.
        It's helpful to understand that AWS Snowball Edge is unique: it's a physical device customers rent to move data or run compute instances without an AWS connection. This means users primarily interact with the service through the Snowball Edge Client, not the typical AWS management console.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        My solution was to drastically refine the topic. I stripped away redundant command information, ensuring only core client usage and commands not better suited elsewhere remained. I personally walked through the client installation process on various operating systems, updating instructions, and had these validated by the support team.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        This targeted approach—reducing noise, improving focus, and ensuring accuracy—across the Snowball Edge documentation led directly to the 30%  in upswing in customer satisfaction.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-2">S3 Documentation Updates with AI Tools</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        I have contributed in a number of ways to the Simple Storage Service (S3) service documentation. In the last year, the service has grown from one to three bucket types to store objects. The documentation needed some follow-on work to include descriptions of the new bucket types and to update procedures to account for changes in the console interface to accommodate the new bucket types.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        I collaborated with the service team and other members of the writing team to develop the new description of [bucket types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html#BasicsBucket) to include the new bucket types (directory and table buckets) and improve the description of the original bucket type (general purpose buckets). The description of each bucket type now clearly explains why customers would want to choose it, describes how access can be granted, and includes a link for detailed information.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        To update procedures to account for the changes in the console interface, I used internal AI tools and a number of prompts to automate the work.
        * I first ensured the tools understood the scope of the functionality of the new bucket types, because only procedures that included functionality of multiple bucket types would need to be changed.
        * Then, I used the tools to identify the procedures that would need to be changed.
        * Finally, I provided the tools the XML code to use to make the changes.
        * For quality control, I spot-checked the changed code and used the text output as input to another AI tool to perform the procedures in the AWS console and identify any problems it found.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">
        Using AI as a work partner was more thorough and less prone to error than other methods, such as searching the documentation for topics that needed to be updated and updating them manually or through a large-scale change like find-replace.
