# Edward Grzetich, Technical Writer

* Experienced technical writer.
* Diverse subjects--software-as-a-service (SaaS) to satellite ground terminals.
* Leadership experience from small teams to $3 million projects.
* Developed and delivered in-person technical training.
* Enriches technical information with hands-on experience with subject matter and meeting and understanding the people who use them and the environments in which they do so.
* Worked remotely for over six years successfully with geographically dispersed teams.
* Intellectually curious; mechanically and technologically apt.

I approach my work looking for tasks or processes to simplify and automate and team members to help. When practical, I try to find my own answers to questions and when not, avoid coming for help with a blank page or an empty hand. I look to meet future goals while using past experience.
