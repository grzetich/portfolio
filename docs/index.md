# Edward Grzetich, Technical Writer

I have contributed to integrated teams designing, developing, and supporting complex systems by creating user assistance information, maintenance information, troubleshooting guides, and descriptive information. I used many sources to develop technical information, including drawings, requirements, design documents, parts lists, test procedures, system performance metrics, direct observation and use of the subject system, and communication with other team members. Information was developed according to military, industry, or corporate standards and typically as structured information designed for single-source reuse.
  
My experience and methods will make an asset to your organization and project:
* I have experience as both an individual contributor and a team leader, estimating and managing schedule and budget and  clearing roadblocks for my team members. 
* I am comfortable representing my team to internal and external customers. I have presented to customers and led meetings and reviews.
* I take every opportunity enrich technical information I produce through hands-on experience with the subjects of my work and meeting and understanding the people who use them and the environments in which they do so.
* I have proficiency in authoring and maintaining technical information in extensible markup language (XML) and reusing it in a content management system.

I approach my work looking for tasks or processes to simplify and automate and team members to help. When practical, I try to find my own answers to questions and when not, avoid coming for help with a blank page or an empty hand. I look to meet future goals while using experience gained in the past.

I have worked successfully in the aerospace and defense and commerical software industries remotely from my home office for over six years, traveling when needed.
